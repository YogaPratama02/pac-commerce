# **PacCommerce Case**

---

### **Problem**

---

-   PacCommerce wanted to create a system to perform membership predictions
-   The membership tiers at PacCommerce consist of:
    -   Platinum
    -   Gold
    -   Silver

### **Solution**

---

-   To make predictions, we can use Euclidean Distance
-   The data required is `monthly_expense` and `monthly_income` from the user
-   After that, to calculate the distance we also need expense and income data from each membership tier
